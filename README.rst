Personal dotfiles
=================

Reusable configuration files for geeks like me.

Already tested on Gentoo, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian servers.

It also work on rich people computers having Macos.

Works out of the box. Or inside the box.

Does not have dependencies!

Install
-------

Get it into your home directory::

    git clone --bare https://github.com/ReekenX/dotfiles ~/.git
    git config core.bare false
    git checkout -f master

Uninstall
---------

Poor man solution::

    git ls-files | xargs rm -i
    rm -rf .git

Why I do not use GNU STOW
-------------------------

I was. You can checkout `cbe687c898d0ed02a18cb95eea6b1b2ad44550b9` and see how nice it works and how cool GNU STOW is.

Unfortunatelly, installing extra dependency in all the servers seems to be a bit too much. Specially, when you are not allowed to do this. Git is more common thing. Even if `git` (command) does not work you still can have dotfiles - from Github zipped file. With GNU STOW that would be impossible.

So that's why I reverted back my dotfiles to the version you can find here.

What you can find here
----------------------

Fixed history for `bpython`.

Properly structured `git` configs without any fancy 3rdparty tools.

Python `pip` tool will cache stuff so repeated installs will go much faster.

Some very basic `rst2pdf` config with improved readability.

Automatic envs creating templates with `tmuxinator` for various projects.

Tons of configuration for `vim` including themes, plugins and etc. Be sure to install plugins with `:PlugInstall`.

Shared history between `bash` and `zsh`.

Nice theme for `dreampie`.

Support for `nvim` with symlinks. Yes, `nvim` is very nice!

Simple `tmux` configuration with nice theme.

GIT tool called `tig` for nice browsing of repos in terminal.

Hardcoded stuff
---------------

I was unable to make bootstrap from this, but it will be easy enough to fix it. Just check two files `.gitconfig` for name and e-mail and the same for `.hgrc`.

License
